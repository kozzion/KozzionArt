# KozzionArt
This repro contains some delightful computer art. 
Currently most of it is javascript. Which is a terrible language but gives results really quickly.



## Particle simulators

### Magnetic Field Curls
The guys at CERN sure make some pretty pictures. We can also run some simulations with made up particles.
Be warned that rendering can be slow especially for older links

## Factal attractors
These projects are inspired by a systems phenomenen called a an attractor state. This is a state towards which proceses in that state tend to converge. While usually attractors are boring lines or circles sometimes they have a chaotic or fractal properties.


### Random homing points
Given n points in a 2d grid we can choose a random op these points to move towards. Varryinging the points and the some of the other parameters these we get some wildly different attractors.

### Random matrix transform
Given a point at [0,0,1] applying random matrix transfomation can make intresting patterns. Barnsley fern is the most famous of these but really every collection of 3by3 matrixes with norms smaller than 1 works.

We can also randomize these matrixes so we get the entire space of shapes (press start and reset a bunch of times)

### Logistic map
Given equation x_n+1 = rx_n(1- x_n) results in a fractal attractor

If we zoom and change the sampling and transform som of the axis:

### N-Body equations
Gravitational attraction with more than 2 bodies can also result in chaotic systems. Using a runge kutta method some of the smaller systems are quite eazy to simulate.


## Sandpiles
Inspired by a numberphile videos on sandpile i wrote some javascrip code to render some awesome ones.
