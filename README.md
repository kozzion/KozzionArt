This repro contains some delightful computer art. 
Currently most of it is javascript. Which is a terrible language but gives results really quickly.


## Particle simulators
The guys at CERN sure make some pretty pictures. We can also run some simulations with made up particles.
Be warned that rendering can be slow especially for older links

## Factal attractors
These projects are inspired by a systems phenomenen called a an attractor state. This is a state towards which proceses in that state tend to converge. While usually attractors are boring lines or circles we can do some intresting things with them. 


### Random homing points
Given n points in a 2d grid we can choose a random op these points to move towards. Varryinging the points and the some of the other parameters these we get some wildly different attractors.

### Random matrix transform
Given a point at [0,0,1] applying random matrix transfomation can make intresting patterns. Barnsley fern is the most famous of these but really every collection of 3by3 matrixes with norms smaller than 1 works.
